# About Me & Portfolio

Hello, I'm Jan, 16 years old student from Poland. I create websites and webapps, down there are all of my public projects. Don't mind all these tabs, they are used as teaching resource by my friends. I just do not want to spend money on hosting and all of this.

## Flashcards
{"files": [{"file": "flashcards_1.png", "alt": "Flashcards' deck menu"}, {"file": "flashcards_2.png", "alt": "Decks' flashcard menu"}, {"file": "flashcards_3.png", "alt": "Training flashcards"}], "folder": "portfolio"}

Technologies used:

- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - state manager,
- [Naviboard](https://github.com/amanboss9/naviboard) - library for dpad navigation,
- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/) - wrapper for indexedDB,
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - preprocessor for CSS.
  What I have learned:
- dealing with hardware limitations of low-end, low-resolution screen phones;
- creating readable layout for low resolution devices;
- storing data in indexedDB using Dexie.js;
- how to navigate using Naviboard.
- exporting apps in [omniSD](https://omnisd.download/) format.

My first (but second rewritten) KaiOS app. The main objective of this app is learning by flashcards using spaced repetition method.

- SASS - preprocessor for CSS.

What I have learned:

- Zipping and unzipping files using JSZip;

My second (not reworked yet) KaiOS. Inspired by [10000+ (Hours Tracker) by Yichuan Ju](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yichuanju.tenkplus&hl=pl&gl=US) but with small screen friendly design.

Technologies used:

- SASS - preprocessor for CSS.

- storing data in indexedDB using vanilla javascript;
- creating keyboard only navigation;
- working with Date API;
- expanded my OOP skills.
