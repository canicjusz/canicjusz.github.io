# About Me & Portfolio

Hello, I'm Jan, 16 years old student from Poland. I create websites and webapps, down there are all of my public projects. Don't mind all these tabs, they are used as teaching resource by my friends. I just do not want to spend money on hosting and all of this.

Technologies used:

- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) &nbsp; - state manager,
- [Naviboard](https://github.com/amanboss9/naviboard) &nbsp; - library for dpad navigation,
- [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/) &nbsp; - wrapper for indexedDB,

  What I have learned:
- dealing with hardware limitations of low-end, low-resolution screen phones;
- creating readable layout for low resolution devices;
- storing data in indexedDB using Dexie.js;
- how to navigate using Naviboard.
- exporting apps in &nbsp; [omniSD](https://omnisd.download/) &nbsp; format.

My second (not reworked yet) KaiOS. Inspired by &nbsp; [10000+ (Hours Tracker) by Yichuan Ju](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yichuanju.tenkplus&hl=pl&gl=US) &nbsp; but with small screen friendly design.

Technologies used:

- SASS - preprocessor for CSS.

- storing data in indexedDB using vanilla javascript;
- creating keyboard only navigation;
- working with Date API;
- expanded my OOP skills.
