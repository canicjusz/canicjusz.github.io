# About Me & Portfolio

Hello, I'm Jan, 16 years old student from Poland. I create websites and webapps, down there are all of my public projects. Don't mind all these tabs, they are used as teaching resource by my friends. I just do not want to spend money on hosting and all of this.

My second (not reworked yet) KaiOS. Inspired by [10000+ (Hours Tracker) by Yichuan Ju](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yichuanju.tenkplus&hl=pl&gl=US) but with small screen friendly design.

Technologies used:

- SASS - preprocessor for CSS.

- storing data in indexedDB using vanilla javascript;
- creating keyboard only navigation;
- working with Date API;
- expanded my OOP skills.
